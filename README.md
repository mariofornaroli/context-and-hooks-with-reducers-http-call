This is a small React hooks + context api bootstrapper to offer an alternative to Redux. The goal is to achieve a centralized state management to leveraging hooks and context api.

No particular attention is given to the presentation part. The meaningful part is the implementation of a similar-Redux cycle, taking advantage of new React Hooks (useReducer api, useContext api, dispatch and action concepts).
